# How the Web Works

## Intro

Working on the web is different from any other medium. For the Web to work, there are two parts: The client and the server. 

You are probably familiar with some Web clients, or Web Browsers. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge are all web browsers that are programmed to send messages to servers identified with URLs, get data back from the server, and render that data into the cat picture gallery that you are browsing.

But how does it work? How does the browser know which server to contact when you type in a URL? How can you get your own web domain? And how does the browser know what to do with the data when it gets it from the server? All of these things are covered in this badge.
