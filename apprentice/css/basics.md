# CSS Basics

## Intro

When HTML was first invented, there were few ways to add style or change the way the elements looked. Inline tags, such as `color=` or `font=` were available, but missed the point of HTML being strictly for markup and not style.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was released in 1996 as a way to add styles to HTML elements. It uses an ingenious method of cascading styles, or having styles override other styles in a predictable way. This allows you to easily reuse styles for multiple elements.

This requirement will cover the three ways to add CSS to your HTML as well as a few selectors and attributes. It will also show you the potential for CSS.
