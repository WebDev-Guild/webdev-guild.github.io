# CSS Layout

## Intro

In the early days of HTML and CSS, you would have to use [tables](http://shouldiusetablesforlayout.com) or invisible images to layout their webpages. Since then, CSS has improved to allow for much more creative layout methods.

There are a lot of new ways to do layout (such as Transforms, Flexbox or CSS Grids). This requirement will focus on the `display`, `position`, `float`, and related attributes.
