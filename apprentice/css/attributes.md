# CSS Basics

## Intro

Elements have dozens of properties, or _attributes_ which you are able to modify. These attributes range from layout and placement to text and font to background to special effects. It is these attributes which you will modify to add styling to your webpage.

We'll focus mostly on font and background. We'll spend time on CSS layout in another requirement.
