# Apprentice Project

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with the principles explained in the [Apprentice WebDev Badge](#), [Apprentice HTML Badge](#), [Apprentice CSS Badge](#), and [Apprentice JavaSript Badge](#) before attempting this project.

## Goals

- Demonstrate your understanding of basic web development principles by developing a personal website with the following features:
  - All work must be your own! No copy-pasting. You can use the design and source of other websites as a reference, but you must code your project yourself.
  - Follow the principles of web safety by not sharing any personal identifying information (other than your first name) on your website.
  - Write at least 3 HTML pages, connected with links. You could do the following pages:
    - About Me
    - My Favorite Sites with links to the websites
    - Some Pictures
    - Anything you want
  - Use a common CSS layout between all pages with a header, footer, sidebar, and main content body.
  - A JavaScript-connected `<select>` dropdown which changes the current theme of the website with CSS (ie. change from a light theme to a dark theme)
  - Your project is a separate Git repository and is hosted on GitHub. *If you are a minor, please get your parents' permission before creating a GitHub account.*
  - Your project is hosted online with GitHub Pages or another hosting service.
  - (Optional, but AwesomeðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥) Your project is hosted on its own domain.

Tips:

- Work with your mentor. This is a common practice for beginning web developers, and your mentor will be able to give you the support you need.
- Review the resources in the Apprentice rank. Everything you need to know for this project can be found in the badges.
- Test out your designs on [CodePen](http://codepen.io).
- Check out some other personal websites to get inspiration for yours.
