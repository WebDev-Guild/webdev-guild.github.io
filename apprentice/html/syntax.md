# HTML Syntax

## Intro

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was invented by Tim Burners-Lee in 1989. It is a subset of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and is not a programming language - it is a markup language. That means it is used to describe data and documents. Since it was first invented, HTML has been revised, updated, and improved since then. The latest version of HTML, HTML5, emphasizes media and syntactically correct markup.

This badge is fairly simple - learn the language and structure of an HTML document.
