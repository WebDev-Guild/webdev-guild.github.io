# HTML Forms

## Intro

HTML is really good at displaying content, but it can also accept content too. IT does this through form elements. This requirement will teach you about `<form>`, `<input />` and all of its types, `<textarea>`, and all of the attributes needed to create a form.

For forms to be really useful, you need to have a server to process and store the input data. However, forms can also be used with JavaScript without needing a server. For example, you could use a `file` input to put an image into a `canvas` element or a `checkbox` to control if a `div` is shown or not.
