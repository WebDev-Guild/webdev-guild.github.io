# Web Safety

## Required Learning

- Read the following points on web safety (taken and adapted from the [New York Public Library](https://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/legal-notices/internet-safety-tips)) Note: These points are focused at minors, but apply to anyone on the internet. 
    - Personal Information. Don’t give out personal information without your parents’ permission. This means you should not share your last name, home address, school name, or telephone number. Remember, just because someone asks for information about you does not mean you have to tell them anything about yourself.
    - Screen Name. When creating your screen name, do not include personal information like your last name or date of birth.
    - Passwords. Don’t share your password with anyone but your parents. When you use a public computer make sure you logout of the accounts you’ve accessed before leaving the terminal. Do not save your passwords on public computers either.
    - Photos. Don’t post photos or videos online without getting your parents’ permission.
    - Online Friends. Don’t agree to meet an online friend unless you have your parents’ permission. Unfortunately, sometimes people pretend to be people they aren't. Remember that not everything you read online is true.
    - Online Ads. Don’t buy anything online without talking to your parents first. Some ads may try to trick you by offering free things or telling you that you have won something as a way of collecting your personal information.
    - Downloading. Talk to your parents before you open an email attachment or download software. Attachments sometimes contain viruses which can damage your computer. Never open an attachment from someone you don’t know. Don't download paid programs from a site offering them for free. These programs are sometimes filled with viruses which can infect your computer.
    - Bullying. Just because you can't see the person you are talking to doesn't mean they don't have feelings. Don’t send or respond to mean or insulting messages. Tell your parents if you receive one. If something happens online that makes you feel uncomfortable, talk to your parents.
    - Social Networking. Many social networking websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and blog hosting websites have legal minimum age requirements to signup. These requirements are there to protect you! Don't sign up for these sites without parent's permission.
    - Be a Selective Sharer. These days, there are a lot of opportunities to share our personal information online. Just be cautious about what you share, particularly when it comes to your identity information. This can potentially be used to impersonate you, or guess your passwords and logins. 
    - Keep your guard up. Always be cautious about what you do online, which sites you visit, and what you share. Use comprehensive security software, and make sure to backup your data on a regular basis in case something goes wrong. By taking preventative measures, you can save yourself from headaches later on.
