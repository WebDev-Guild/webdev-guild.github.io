# Terminal

## Intro

Since the earliest days of computers, dumb computers called terminals would be used to send commands to supercomputers. Today, we use terminal emulators to provide us with direct, low-level access to our computers. Because of the many tools which use command-line interfaces, being proficient at using terminals and command-line environments is an important skill for web developers. 

This tutorial will focus on Bash, a common terminal shell emulator. Windows users will have to perform additional steps to get into a Bash environment.

*Please be careful with the terminal. There is no `undo`, so you can irreversibly damage your computer. **Double check your commands before you run them**. ðŸ’£**NEVER** run `sudo rm -rf /`. It will delete all of your files immediately!ðŸ’£*
