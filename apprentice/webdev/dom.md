# The DOM

## Intro

When a web browser loads an HTML file from a server, that file comes in the form of text. It is the job of the Browser to parse the text and translate it from text into elements on the page. That mapping of HTML to rendered elements is called the Document Object Model, or DOM.

Once the DOM is loaded and rendered from the HTML documents, it can be manipulated with JavaScript. That is one of the most common uses of JavaScript.
