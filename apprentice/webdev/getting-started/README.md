# Getting Started

To get started with WebDev, you need some tools. Here's a recommended list to get yourself started:

- [Atom](atom.io) - A text editor with built in syntax hiliting
- [Google](google.com) - Yes, Google. It really is the most helpful thing in the world for finding answers to your questions
- CLI - Find your command line or terminal. It's called Terminal on Mac and PowerShell on Windows.
- [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com) - A great place to ask your questions and get answers from real devs.
- [GitHub](github.com) - The site that you are on. GitHub has become a prolific site for collaborating on code. Get an account to get contributing.

You should also get involved in the WebDev guild in other ways:

- Get in touch with your mentor. If you don't have a mentor, [contact one](../../../#mentors).
- Participate in the WebDev Guild meetups and livestreams.
