# SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

## Intro

SVG is a Scalable Vector Graphics, which basically means it is a language used for to create two-dimensional vector graphics. These graphics can be used to create complex or simple graphics that can be animated in a variety of ways. An important fact to note is that SVG images do not lose graphic qualties when resized, which is not always the case when dealing with standard images or icon fonts.
