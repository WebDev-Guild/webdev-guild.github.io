# Markdown 

## Intro

Markdown is a text-to-html tool for web developers. It allows you to write information that is easy to write, and easy to read, than it converts it to an HTML structure for you. 

## Suggested Learning

- Read the Intro and Syntax on [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- Follow this [Markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) for hands on learning.

## Requirements

- Create a markdown file containing whatever you want.
- It must include: 
    - A header
    - A description
    - A link
    - An image
- You can do this on an online markdown editor. A good one to use is [Markdown Editor.](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/)
- Share your file (or a link if you decided to use the online editor) with the `#requirements` Discord channel to show you have passed this requirement off.
