# Linux 

## Intro

Before Linux, there were no free, open operating systems. Linux (and its derivatives) have made it possible to run servers on the internet incredibly cheaply (since you don't have to pay for operating system licenses).

Linux is more similar to macOS than it is to Windows, but it has several differences. You might think that one of those differences is that you can only use Linux with a command line, but there are actually GUIs for Linux that are very powerful and user friendly.

There are also many popular distros or flavors of Linux, forked from the main version. Some of these are:

- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Fedora
- Arch Linux
- CentOS

In the WebDev Guild, we'll focus on Ubuntu (for servers) and Debian/Raspian (for RaspberryPi). These two operating systems are fairly similar and are easy to install and use.
