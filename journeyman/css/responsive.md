# Responsive CSS & Media Queries

## Intro

Since 2007 and the iPhone, there has been a greater emphasis on making webpages look good on screens of all shapes and sizes. Responsive Web Design means that your webpage responds to the screen size of the device displaying it. This is something which you usually have to deliberately program in to your site, especially if you have a complex layout. This has lead to the practice of always designing your mobile/small screen layout first.

CSS provides tools for detecting and changing your CSS based on a number of factors, including the size of the screen. These are called 'Media Queries' and learning how to use them will enable to you make all of your webpages responsive and functional on screens of any size.
