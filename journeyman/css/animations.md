# CSS Animations and Transitions

## Intro

Until recently, you had to use JavaScript to make any kind of animation on a webpage. Recently, CSS Animations and Transitions were released. They both allow you to create animations of some kind, but they have different purposes:

- CSS Animations allow you to animate between multiple CSS properties over a period of time. It allows for using easing functions, keyframed animations, and changing multiple properties at the same time. CSS Animations are powerful, and as such are slightly more complicated.
- CSS Transitions make it so you can animate a change between two values of a specific CSS property. Like CSS Animations, you can change the time of the transition and the easing function, but you have to specify every single property with it's own transition duration and it doesn't allow for keyframing values. It isn't as flexible as CSS Animations, but it is incredibly simple and is especially useful for hover transitions and changing classes with JavaScript.

Animations and Transitions can greatly enrich the experience on your website for your user.
