# CSS Grid Layout

## Intro

Just like Flexbox revolutionized layout in one dimension, CSS Grid makes major strides in 2 dimensional layout. If you can express your layout with columns and rows, you can make it with CSS Grid. It allows you to create specific 'tracks' for columns and rows which your content aligns itself to. You can also specifically specify how many columns and rows you want your content to use. Finally, you can declare specific 'grid areas' and assign elements to those areas for very fine-grained control of your layout
