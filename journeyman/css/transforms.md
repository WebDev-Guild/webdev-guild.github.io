# CSS Transforms

## Intro

Transforms were recently added to CSS. They allow you to transform elements in 2D or 3D. This can be used to create some interesting views, such as [CSS Dice](https://codepen.io/tameraydin/pen/CADvB). The most basic transforms are `translate`, `rotate`, and `scale`. Mixing these together can create incredible effects.

In addition, using CSS transforms is more performant in animations than adjusting other attributes, such as top and left. If you want your animations to be fast, use CSS transforms!
