# JavaScript Tooling

## Intro

Web Development has gained a lot of useful tools for making it easier for developers to create great websites. However, with these tools comes a bit more complexity. Babel, CSS Preprocessors, testing frameworks, ESLint, Webpack, minifiers, and a host of other tools need to be applied to your code to gain their features. This requirement is going to show you how to install and configure a few of these tools.
 
## Prerequisites

It is suggested that you understand the following:
  - NPM
  - ES6
  - CSS Preprocessors

## Suggested Learning

- [Using NPM Scripts to run a build process](https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/)
- Look at the usage instructions for several popular tools:
  - JavaScript:
    - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/) - Choose the 'CLI' option
    - [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)
    - [UglifyJS](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/)
  - CSS
    - [LESS](http://lesscss.org/#using-less)
    - [NODE-SASS](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#install) and [SASS guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
    - [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/#get-styling-with-stylus)

## Requirements

- Create a project which includes ES6 JavaScript and CSS code with a preprocessor
- Wire up a `package.json` with sufficient scripts to use several of these tools. Include, at least, Babel and a CSS Preprocessor. Make it so each tool has it's own command, and have a command that runs all of the tools together.
- Include a `postinstall` script in your `package.json`
- Show your project to your mentor to get passed off
