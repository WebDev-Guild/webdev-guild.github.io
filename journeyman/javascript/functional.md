# Functional JavaScript

## Intro

No, I don't mean that JavaScript is normally *not* functional. Instead, this badge is to teach you how to write your JavaScript code using functions almost exclusively. There are a lot of interesting concepts that come about because of this:

- Pure functions, or functions that take arguments and return a value without mutating a variable outside of the function. This makes it so you know every time you run a function with the same arguments it will return the same value.
- Higher order functions, or functions that take a function as an argument and return another function.
- Immutability, or never changing the value of a variable in place. Once a variable is set, you never change that value.
- How to handle side-effects of your functions, like performing network requests or writing to a file
- The difference between imperative and declarative programming

It's a powerful paradigm which JavaScript supports. Learning it will help prepare you to learn React, which is heavily inspired by a functional paradigm.
