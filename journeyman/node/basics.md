# Node Basics

## Intro

Before NodeJS, there were no ways of writing servers in JavaScript. You would have to use another language, like PHP, Java, Ruby, or Python. That meant that you had to know at least two languages to write applications which utilize both a server and a web browser. 

Then, in 2009, NodeJS was created. It allows you to use JavaScript to write code that can run on either the client or the server (or both). This provides incredible flexibility and gives more strength to the notion of 'JavaScript Everywhere'. 

This requirement will focus on the basics of NodeJS:

- Installing
- Running scripts
- Basic module loading and usage
