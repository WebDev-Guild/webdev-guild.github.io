# NPM (Node Package Manager)

## Intro

Node supports external packages, or "modules". NPM was created to serve as a repository for Node package. NPM is both the online repository and a command line tool for downloading, managing, and using NPM packages. NPM also provides additional features, like package configuration options and lifecycle scripts.

NPM packages fall under three categories:

* Packages that only work on Node
* Command line tools, like ESLint and Flow
* Front-end packages for browsers. *Note: to use these packages, you have to bundle them somehow to make them available to the browser.*

NPM is built into Node, so you can install NPM by installing [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

## Suggested Learning

- Download and install NPM (by installing [Node](https://nodejs.org/)) if you haven't already.
- Learn about [`package.json`](https://nodesource.com/blog/the-basics-of-package-json-in-node-js-and-npm). This is where references to your NPM packages are stored.
- Learn about [using NPM Scripts](https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/) for your build process.
