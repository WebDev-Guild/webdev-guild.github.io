# Meteor

## Intro

Meteor is a batteries-included framework for building reactive web apps with JavaScript. It comes with it's own package manager, uses NodeJS for the server, MongoDB for the database, and provides real-time communication between the clients and server with little effort on the developers part. Meteor is a great place to start when making complicated web apps.

## Prerequisites

While knowledge of NodeJS and MongoDB are helpful when working with Meteor, they are not required. In fact, using Meteor can help you grasp the concepts of those and other technologies in a sandboxed environment. 

That said, you definitely need to be comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before attempting this elective. Apprentice Rank or higher is recommended.
