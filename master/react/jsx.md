# JSX

## Intro

React is written in pure JavaScript. This gives it great flexibility, allowing to use JavaScript anywhere in your components. However, for a traditional web developer, this can be a bit challenging, since you are used to writing HTML.

Enter JSX, an extension to the JavaScript language. JSX allows you to write JavaScript that looks like HTML. Using a preprocessor, like Babel, the JSX is converted to JavaScript function calls at build time ensuring that your code works in web browsers.

JSX can be a little funky, but it doesn't take long to pick up and can make your React code much more readable.
