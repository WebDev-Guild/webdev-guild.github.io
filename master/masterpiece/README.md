# Masterpiece

To be considered for advancement to the rank of master, you must complete a master project. The code for all projects must be reviewed by a master mentor. The masterpiece does not have to use technologies taught in this course but should demonstrate principles learned. It should demonstrate good design (both visual and technical) and show good coding technique. The master project may fall into these categories:

- A standalone project.
- A notable contribution to an open-source project.

Projects for work or private repositories will not be considered.
