# Wanted: Curious Learners

Web development is a pretty comprehensive topic. Unlike other programming practices where you only learn one programming language (like Java or C++), to be a web developer you have to learn three! HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all essential to being a good web developer. 

You aren't going to get good overnight. In fact, it will take months and years of study, practice, and experience to become truly capable. You might feel like there is always something more to learn, and you'd be right! Developers are always coming up with new ways to develop for the web, hoping it will become the next big thing.

You might feel like you have to learn everything overnight. That's a normal feeling, but not necessary. In fact, if you try learning too much at once, you might get overwhelmed and give up, and that's the worst thing you can do. Instead, take your learning in byte-sized chunks. Get good at the foundational stuff, then try out some more stuff to see what you like. Eventually, you'll find tools and methods that you really enjoy working with which you can focus your studies on.

That's the purpose of the Webdev Guild Advancement program. Here, you will find resources and guides on every topic necessary to get started in web development. The hope is that as you learn and get a taste of what is possible, your curiosity will keep you learning and improving.

Chris Pearce recently wrote about [how Webdev is an all-encompasing process](https://medium.com/fed-or-dead/javascript-really-is-overtaking-the-world-5b59b5af41ed). He mentioned things that good front end web developers should be good at:
> To end, here’s a list of skills, characteristics, disciplines, et cetera, that I think an experienced front end developer should have:
> - Can write semantic HTML including technologies that extend HTML to make it more machine-readable, for example: WAI-ARIA, Microdata.
> - Can write CSS at scale.
> - Can write UI focused JavaScript (preferably ECMAScript 6) including unit tests. I think it’s expecting too much of a front end developer to be able to write high quality application focused JavaScript and to architect and build an application end-to-end, however, you should feel comfortable working in applications consuming RESTful APIs.
> - Can write highly readable and maintainable code.
> - Can build highly componentised UI’s, for example, you’re really good at abstracting UI patterns.
> - Can build responsive, accessible, performant, and resilient (cross-browser/device) UI’s.
> - Can work with a JavaScript framework/library, such as React. I don’t think this is super critical though, if you have a decent handle on JavaScript and DOM fundamentals then picking one of these up shouldn’t be too hard.
> - Can work with front end tooling such as: Webpack, Gulp, Babel, ESLint, Stylelint, PostCSS, NPM, Git, Browser dev tools, et cetera.
> - Has a solid understanding of how browsers work, such as: Critical rendering path.
> - Has a solid understanding of what makes for good user experiences (UX) and has an appreciation for design.
> - Has attention to detail.

These are all attributes that I hope you take away from your experience with the Webdev Guild. Most of all, I hope you gain a sense of your own ability to learn and do hard things. 

Stay curious, my friends.
