## About the Badges

Badges are awarded at the following levels:

- Apprentice
- Journeyman
- Master

### Apprentice üëç
You are getting your feet wet and gaining basic literacy in a skill category. You will use study materials to prove a basic knowledge of a skill. You will also be proving your ability in that skill through building a micro-project with a very specific and prescriptive set of requirements. As an alternative to building new projects, you may use previous work and a few other options to pass this level's badges.

### Journeyman üí™
You are actively applying your knowledge to produce quality code in new and creative ways. You are also demonstrating your knowledge of advanced concepts in your production code. As an alternative to project work, a developer can use previous project or production work to pass this level's badges. You must have previously completed all Apprentice badges to earn the Journeyman rank.

### Master üî•
You have mastered the fundamental and advanced concepts of this skill and you are very skilled in its application. You often mentor and teach others in skills. You will be qualified to work on large-scale projects with complicated architectures or creative projects with uncommon tools. You must have previously completed all Journeyman badges and have created a Masterpiece to earn the Master rank.
