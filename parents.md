# What is the WebDev Guild - A guide for parents

Howdy, and welcome to the WebDev Guild! Yes, I think both you and your child should get involved in the guild, but I'll talk about that later. First, I want to try to answer some of your questions.

## What is the WebDev Guild?

The WebDev Guild is a website programming club for kids. We provide resources and guides for students (we call them Guilders) to learn principles of web development. This isn't a watered-down program - The resources we provide are real-world guides created by industry leaders. The goal is to have our Guilders able to assemble fully functional web apps once they complete all of the badges and requirements.

Guilders are paired with experienced adult mentors who will answer their questions, guide their learning, and pass off their requirements.

The Guild also has regular meetings where Guilders meet to discuss and recieve recognition for their progress, show off the projects they are working on, and work on badge requirements.

## Is there anything I should be worried about?

As with anything on the internet, there are a few risks with being involved in the WebDev Guild:

- Programmers sometimes use _saucy_ language in their blog posts and guides. Since many of the badges encourage Guilders to do their own searching, they might come across this language.
- Guilders could choose to cyberbully other Guilders on the Discord messaging platform.
- Your child's personal information could be put on the internet for other people to find.

We take these matters very seriously and employ the following measures to combat them:

- We ensure that all of our badges link to posts and guides of the highest quality. If we find that these guides are not up to our standards, we remove them immediately.
- We do not tolerate cyberbullying of any kind. If we recieve reports of cyberbullying, we immediately suspend the offender's Discord account and if we find cyberbullying did happen, the offender will be ejected from the guild.
- We require all minors to complete the [Apprentice Web Safety Requirement](apprentice/webdev/safety.md) before they are allowed to pass off any other badges. 

We are also looking into requiring background checks for all of our volunteers and mentors. 

We want to ensure that our Guilders have the best experience possible, and your feedback is most helpful. If you have any other concerns or questions, please [get in touch](mailto:alexanderson1993@gmail.com).

## Why should I be involved?

There is plenty of evidence that parents being involved in the activities their children participate in helps the child to succeed. This article explains how parents learning to code can catalyze their child's learning:  [Parenting by Example: Why Parents Must Learn to Code](https://www.care.com/c/stories/3240/why-coding-for-kids-is-something-all-parents/)

Our classes and curriculum are designed for kids and adults alike, so you should be able follow along just fine. We're also very intersted in feedback and would love to hear your thoughts about our meetings and materials. And who knows? Maybe you'll find that you really like programming!

## How can I be involved?

Here are a few things that might help:

- Attend the guild meetings with your child.
- The online services which we use require a parent's permission to use. You can help your child by assisting them with creating accounts on those services. Specifically, those are:
  - [Discord](https://discordapp.com)
  - [Github](https://github.com)
  - [CodePen](https://codepen.io)
- Ask your child about what they are learning in the WebDev Guild. Work through the badge requirements with them.

We look forward to your involvement in the WebDev Guild! Again, if you have any questions, please [get in touch](mailto:alexanderson1993@gmail.com).
