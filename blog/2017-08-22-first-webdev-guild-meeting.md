# Announcing the WebDev Guild

Calling all budding programmers! Want to learn how to develop websites? Want to get involved in programming controls and panels for the space centers? Read on!

I'm pleased to announce the WebDev Guild, an independent guild for the next generation of web developers. The demand for good Web Developers is exploding - the WebDev Guild will help to prepare you to meet that demand. Through meet-ups, training videos, and the advancement program, in a short time you'll become prepared to take on real jobs making real websites. The program will also serve as a way to get involved in programming controls for the Voyager and other simulators.

The WebDev Guild is designed for anyone to be able to get involved, learn, and get the help they need. We separate Guilders by three ranks: Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master. Each rank has several badges which cover aspects of web development (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and using the command line terminal) and which lead up to a final project to complete before achieving each rank.

The requirements for the badges have explanations, learning resources, and step-by-step assignments to complete. WebDev Guilders (or guild members) are encouraged to learn on their own with the resources provided. In addition, every WebDev Guilder will have access to a team of mentors who can answer questions and guide them through their learning. Finally, we will have regular meetings to coordinate efforts and provide in-person training for the badges. Think of it like Boy or Girl Scout troop meetings.

We won't just cover Web Development topics either. We're currently putting together resources for UI design, general application development, electronics and hardware programming, analytics and statistics and more. Everyone can find something interesting to learn in the WebDev Guild.

Want to get involved? Here's what you should do:

* Check out the advancement guide: https://webdev-guild.github.io
* Join our discussion group on Discord: https://discord.gg/PUcnnjV
* Want to be a mentor? Get in touch with one of the current mentors: https://webdev-guild.github.io#mentors

Finally, come to our first guild meeting! All are welcome, regardless of age or experience. Our gracious host is Farpoint's Voyager Club. Our first meeting will be on Saturday, September 9th at 9:30 AM at Renaissance Academy. Meetings will continue every other week.

We look forward to you joining us and can't wait to see what you make!

Alex & Crystal Anderson, Matt Ricks, and Isaac Ostler
